# COSC2803 Week01 Starter Code
This repository contains the starter code for:
* Java practice exercises
* HTML practice exercises

## Java Practice Exercises
Contained in the folder 'java'.
This is for practicing how to:
* Clone an assignment repository from GitHub Classroom
* Revise Java programming from Bootcamp
* Commit and Push the code changes to GitHub

## HTML Practice Exercises
Contained in the folder 'html'.
This is a simple template for a basic HTML site. This is a cutdown version of the HTML for Julie's page Version 1. You are able to use this HTML as a starting point for creating your own page in the Project Workshop for Week 01.

# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V17) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
